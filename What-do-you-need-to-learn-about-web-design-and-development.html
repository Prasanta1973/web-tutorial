With the growth of digital media in today's era, the demand for creating websites is increasing. Almost every field, from business, education, health care, now requires an attractive and effective website. As a result, web designing and development is an important and profitable skill today. For those who want to enter the new world, it is important to learn certain things first. In addition, there are some academic topics that make learning web development easier and more effective.<br><br><b>The first step to learning web design </b><br>Web design begins with HTML. It is the basic language for creating web pages. HTML defines how text, images, tables, links, forms, etc. fit into a page. After learning HTML, you need to learn CSS, which makes the web page attractive in terms of colour, font, spacing, and layout. Through CSS, the website can be made responsive or mobile friendly, which is very important now.<br><br>Next, you need to learn JavaScript, which makes the website interactive. How the website interacts with the user, such as: what happens when the button is clicked, how the data is verified when the form is filled - all this is possible with JavaScript. These three are the basics of web design.<br><br>Once the basic parts are learnt, it is necessary to learn the Version Control System, especially Git and GitHub. With their help, project files can be saved and managed, especially if you work in a team.<br><br><b>The next stage of web development </b><br>After the design, those who want to work on the functionality of the website, can learn backend development. This requires learning a programming language like Node.js, PHP, Python or Java. It is possible to learn MySQL or MongoDB to connect databases. This knowledge takes one to the level of a full-stack developer.<br><br>Also, using Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS as a framework can create beautiful and responsive websites in a short time. Libraries such as React.js or Vue.js for JavaScript can also be learnt, which make it possible to create one-page applications (SPA).<br><br><b>Academic topics related to web design </b><br>In addition to learning web designing, there are some academic topics that are easier to learn. For example, a student studying computer science or information technology gets a good understanding of programming, algorithms, and software development. This makes it easy to understand the technical aspects while learning web development.<br><br>It also helps improve math skills, especially logic and problem-solving. These skills are very useful when learning JavaScript or other programming languages. Having English and technical writing skills makes it much easier to create website content, write blogs, or communicate with clients.<br><br>If you have an interest in graphic design or fine arts, there are distinct advantages in the field of design. Visual sense is needed to understand how a website will look, what colours will be used, where the user will want to click. Also, those who have studied business or marketing, understand how a website can attract customers and increase brand value.<br><br>Learning web design and development today is not only a means of building a career, it is also a field of expressing creativity. If you learn the right way and step by step, a new student can also be able to create a project within a few months. Also, if there is a suitable academic background or subject of interest, the speed and depth of learning increases.
